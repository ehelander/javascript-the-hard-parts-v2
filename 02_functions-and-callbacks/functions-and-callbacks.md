# Functions & Callbacks

## [Generalized Functions](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/generalized-functions/)

- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Parameters (placeholders) mean we don't have to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function.
  - But this isn't just limited to data: We can leave some of our functionality TBD &rarr; higher-order functions.

## [Higher Order Functions](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/higher-order-functions/)

- A higher-order function: Passing functionality as a parameter
